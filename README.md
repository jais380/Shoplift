# 🛒 SHOPLIFT – Django REST E-Commerce API

SHOPLIFT is a backend e-commerce REST API built with Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF).
It provides product management, user authentication with JWT, and a robust shopping cart system with transactional safety and business rules enforced at the database level.

This project is designed as a backend-only service, ready to be consumed by a frontend (React, HTMX, mobile app, etc.).

# 🚀 Features

📦 Products
